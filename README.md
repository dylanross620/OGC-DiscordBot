# OGC-DiscordBot
A Discord chat bot for the Online Go Club

## Setup
This project requires the discord.py and the irc modules. This can be installed using pip by using ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```.
Additionally, there must be a file named 'discord_token.env' that just contains the bot token that can be received from Discord and a file named 'twitch_token.env'
that should contain the Twitch bot's OAuth token and Client ID on the first and second lines respectively.

## Running
To run the bot, perform setup if you have not already. Once setup is completed run ```python main.py```
